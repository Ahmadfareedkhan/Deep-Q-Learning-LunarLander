# Deep-Q-Learning-LunarLander
In this notebook, you will train an agent to land a lunar lander safely on a landing pad on the surface of the moon.

We'll make use of the following packages:

numpy is a package for scientific computing in python.
deque will be our data structure for our memory buffer.
namedtuple will be used to store the experience tuples.
The gym toolkit is a collection of environments that can be used to test reinforcement learning algorithms. We should note that in this notebook we are using gym version 0.24.0.
PIL.Image and pyvirtualdisplay are needed to render the Lunar Lander environment.
We will use several modules from the tensorflow.keras framework for building deep learning models.
utils is a module that contains helper functions for this assignment. You do not need to modify the code in this file.
Run the cell below to import all the necessary packages.
